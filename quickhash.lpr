{   Quick Hash - A Linux, Windows and Apple Mac GUI for quickly selecting one or more files
    and generating hash values for them.

    Copyright (C) 2011-2023  Ted Smith www.quickhash-gui.org

    The use of the word 'quick' refers to the ease in which the software operates
    in both Linux, Apple Mac and Windows (very few options to worry about, no
    syntax to remember etc) though tests suggest that in most cases the hash
    values are generated as quick or quicker than most mainstream tools.

    The user should be aware of other data hashing tools and use them to cross-check
    findings for critical data :
    md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum and sha512sum (for Linux),
    FTK Imager, X-Ways Forensics, WinHex, EnCase, FTK (Windows) and many more

    Benchmark tests are welcomed.

    Contributions from members at the Lazarus forums, Stackoverflow and other
    StackExchnage groups are welcomed and acknowledged. Contributions from
    DaReal Shinji are also welcomed and acknowledged, particularly helping with
    Debian package creation and ideas

    NOTE: Date and time values, as computed in recursive directory hashing, are not
    daylight saving time adjusted. Source file date and time values are recorded.

    QuickHash is created using the Freepascal Compiler and Lazarus-IDE
    http://www.lazarus-ide.org/ developed by Sourceforge users :
    mgaertner,
    mhess,
    user4martin,
    vlx,
    vsnijders

    QuickHash was first registered on sourceforge on 29th May 2011 and was later
    migrated to the domain www.quickhash-gui.org in December 2016.
